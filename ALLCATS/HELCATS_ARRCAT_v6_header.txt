This ARRival CATalog (ARRCAT) is a product of working packages 3 and 4 in the EU HELCATS project (2014-2017). 

It lists predicted arrivals of solar coronal mass ejections at various spacecraft and planets with the STEREO heliospheric imager instruments, between April 2007 - September 2014.

 VARIABLES: 
	1: ID: From HICAT, the unique identifier for the observed CME.

	17: PA_CENTER: average of pa_n and pa_s, unit: degree.

Notes:

1. We have applied the method from Möstl & Davies (2013, Solar Physics) for calculating speeds and arrival times of the CMEs modeled with SSEF30 to all CMEs in the HELCATS HIGeoCAT catalog (see website helcats-fp7.eu, and Möstl et al. 2014, ApJ, for more details). If the SSEF30 circle hits a spacecraft or planet, an entry in ARRCAT is produced.

2. The position of Venus Express is assumed equal to the location of Venus. Arrivals at Ulysses are calculated only around its last ecliptic pass in August 2007. For Rosetta, no arrivals are calculated during its deep space hibernation from 2011 June 8 to 2014 January 20. For MESSENGER, MSL and MAVEN ARRCAT covers both the cruise and orbit phases of those missions.
